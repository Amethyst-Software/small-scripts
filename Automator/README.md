# Small Scripts/Automator
Double-click a .workflow in Finder to install it to the Quick Actions or Services context menu.
- **Compress (Windows-friendly)**: An implementation of the script "zip_safe.sh" in [Small-scripts/Bash](../Bash). When right-clicking a folder, this workflow offers to create a .zip from it that won't contain the infamous .DS_Store files from macOS that become visible in Windows. It also leaves out .svn and .git directories in case those are present.
- **Scale image to 50%**: (Note that this script requires ImageMagick to be installed on the command line.) Right-click an image and this workflow will offer to scale it down to 50%. Useful when you have a screenshot saved in a 2x backing scale from a Mac using a Retina display, and you don't want it to appear huge when posted somewhere online and viewed at 1x.
- **Scale image to 50% (nearest neighbor)**: The same script as above, but it tells ImageMagick not to interpolate when scaling down. Useful when you take a screenshot of an emulated environment that runs in 1x backing scale but which was integer-scaled up to 2x for your Retina display. Using the above workflow would produce a fuzzy screenshot of the environment at the correct scale, whereas this one will give you a crisp restoration of the 1x environment's actual pixels, if the pixels really were scaled up cleanly to begin with.
