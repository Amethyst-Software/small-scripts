# Small Scripts
Various utility scripts that I've written over the years.
- **Automator/**: Automator workflows written in AppleScript/Bash and intended for the Services or Quick Actions context menus in macOS.
- **Bash/**: Smaller scripts written for the Mac's version of the Bash shell. (Larger Bash scripts have their own individual repositories under this GitHub account.)
- **Folder Actions/**: Scripts written in AppleScript and intended for use as Folder Actions in macOS.
