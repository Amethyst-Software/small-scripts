# Duplicate and Name
# Duplicates a single file and names each copy with the same name as the
# files found in a given folder. In other words, the contents of the file
# passed as $1 will be copied into folder $3 once for every file in folder
# $2, with each copy named after one of those files. The suffix of the file
# duplicates is changed to what is hardcoded below.
